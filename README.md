Hello! My name is Carl (he/him), I am 33 going on 34, and am a new programming student.

I have been working in the hospitality industry for years, but have always had a passion for computers and am looking for a change in careers!

I spend most of my freetime playing video games with friends or chatting with my boyfriend.
