Hello! My name is Carl (he/him), I am a junior software developer!.

I have been working in the hospitality industry for years, but have always had a passion for computers and am looking for a change in careers!

Currently I am learning the ins and outs of java and will soon be graduating from a coding bootcamp. Most of my side projects involve helping my freinds create things for the various TTRPGs we play.
